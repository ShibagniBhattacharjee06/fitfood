# 🍕 FoodLens – AI-Powered Food Recognition & Nutrition Analyzer

## 📄 Project Description
**FoodLens** is a full-stack AI web application that allows users to upload a photo of their meal and receive an instant breakdown of its nutritional content — including calories, carbs, fats, and protein — item by item. Built using computer vision and language models, the app provides smart, real-time insights into what you're really eating.

## 🎯 Project Vision
To empower individuals to make healthier food choices using AI by offering an accessible, image-based nutrition analysis tool — transforming everyday meals into transparent, data-driven decisions.

## 🔭 Future Scope
- 📱 Mobile App Integration (Android/iOS) for easier food logging on-the-go  
- 📊 Personalized Nutrition Dashboard with history tracking  
- 📷 Real-time camera detection instead of photo upload  
- 🧠 Advanced food recognition using deep learning models (e.g., YOLOv8, EfficientNet)  
- 🥗 Meal suggestions based on dietary goals or restrictions  
- 🌍 Multilingual support for global users  
- 🔗 Integration with fitness apps and wearables (Fitbit, Google Fit)
